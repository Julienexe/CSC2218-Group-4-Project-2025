# Banking System Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines the development plan for a banking system, designed for incremental development and maintenance by a team of four members. The system will be built with a focus on clean code principles, ensuring readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## System Goals

- **Core Banking Operations:** Implement fundamental banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
- **Transaction Management:** Maintain a secure and auditable transaction history for each account.
- **User Authentication:** Securely authenticate users to protect their financial data.
- **Reporting:** Generate reports on account activity and system performance.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a growing number of users and transactions.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented code to facilitate future updates and bug fixes.

## Team Structure

- **Team Size:** 4 members
- **Roles:**
  - **Backend Developer (2):** Responsible for designing and implementing the core banking logic, database interactions, and API endpoints.
  - **Frontend Developer:** Responsible for creating the user interface and user experience.
  - **QA/Tester:** Responsible for writing and executing test cases, ensuring code quality, and identifying bugs.

## Development Methodology

- **Incremental Development:** The system will be developed in weekly iterations, with each iteration adding new features or improving existing ones.
- **Agile/Scrum:** We will use Agile/Scrum principles for project management, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews.
- **Clean Code:** We will adhere to clean code principles, including:
  - Meaningful names
  - Single responsibility principle
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - Clear and concise code
  - Proper documentation
- **Version Control:** Git will be used for version control, with a branching strategy to manage development, testing, and production.
- **Code Reviews:** All code will undergo peer review before being merged into the main branch.

## Weekly Development Plan

Each week will focus on a specific set of features or improvements. The following is a high-level outline of the weekly plan:

## Week 1: Core Setup

- Set up the development environment.
- Create the project structure.
- Implement basic user authentication.
